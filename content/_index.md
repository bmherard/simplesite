ABOUT ME

# A Passion for Developing & Designing Great Experiences

#### My Career Passion

My specialties include implementing User Experience, Interaction and E-commerce Design, leading Experience Designers and managing multiple digital brands.

I approach leadership roles and work assignments with a critical eye, creative thinking, flexibility and a touch of humor. I'm a team player who also challenges the status quo. Standing still isn't acceptable. Taking risks helps me learn and grow. I'm a right and left brained marketer who mixes numbers, functionality and aesthetics for ultimate usability.
