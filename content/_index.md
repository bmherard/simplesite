ABOUT ME

# Fueled By A Passion For Building Great Experiences

Throughout my career I've had the opportunity to come up with great solutions to some interesting problems. To complete a variety of website projects I've worked solo and on teams with very talented people. I'm very fortunate to have been able to grow as a developer and designer by tackling some unique challenges.

Working on websites for both business-to-business and business-to-consumer companies has been very rewarding. Developing, designing and marketing great e-commerce experiences has been my focus for over 10 years. My passion for making sites easy to use and something visitors want to return to has been fueled by interests in human interaction, user experience and a companies success.
