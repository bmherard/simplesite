ABOUT ME

# Driven By A Passion For Developing & Designing Great Experiences

For more than 10 years I have been developing, designing, and marketing web sites with a big focus on on e-commerce. Whether it's a leadership role or a work assignment, I approach my job with a critical eye, creative thinking, flexibility and a touch of humor.

I'm a team player but will challenge the status quo if it may lead to improvements. Standing Still isn't acceptable so taking risks is helps me learn and grow. I'm a right and left brained thinker overlapping creative designs with functional development. I enjoy blending analytics, functionality and aesthetics for ultimate usability.

I feel very passionately that every touch point, not just digital ones, should be met with delight.
