### Performance, Security and Simplicity

Some of the top reasons for using static site generators (SSGs) are improved website performance, security and ease of use. Static sites display pages to visitors almost instantaneously. Static sites don't run code as pages load and tend to be more secure than dynamic site generators (DSGs). And, building a website with a static site generator is fairly straight forward, once you learn the particulars of the SSG.  

It's important to note that the term “static” means the SSG builds a page once, in contrast to a DSG that builds pages as they are requested by the viewer. The net result are pages that display identically without anyone being the wiser. "Static" doesn't mean the site or pages never change or don't have dynamic features.  

The popularity of the Jamstack (JavaScript, APIs and Markup) over the last several years has helped boost the use of SSGs. To complement this desire there are a growing number of open source static site generators available to choose from including, but not limited to, <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com">Gatsby</a>, <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>, <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a>, <a href="https://www.11ty.dev">11ty</a> and <a href="https://blog.getpelican.com">Pelican</a>. At their core, these solutions compile the digital assets you need for deploying your site to the hosting platform of your choice.  

### So why not choose a Content Management System?

So the elephant in the room is <a href="https://wordpress.org">WordPress</a>. Why not just use the content management system (CMS) that powers more than 40% of the Web? Wordpress definitely serves a need and can do a lot. I have personally used it on projects in the past. But it can be slow, depending on the hosting provider (which in many cases is a shared environment) and because of calls to a server and database. Because it's a one size fits all with plugins from third parties the code can become very bloated and it is rather vulnerable to hacking. It's very important to keep up with updates that come out.

### Conclusion

Many sites on the web don't need slow CMSs that dynamically generates pages. Brochure style sites and blogs that migrate to Static Site Generators to build their pages typically see faster load times that subsequently correlate to longer time on site. More time on site increases the chance of getting more leads and conversions. Isn't that an important metric of any website?

Static Site Generators aren't for everyone or every use case. But, if you don't have the need for a traditional database running on a dynamically generated site and you want blazing fast page load speeds, my suggestion is try out a Static Site Generator.
