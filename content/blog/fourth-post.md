### Performance, Security and Simplicity

Some of the top reasons for using static site generators (SSGs) are improved website performance, security and ease of use. Static sites display pages to visitors almost instantaneously. Static sites don't run code as a page loads and tend to more secure than dynamic site generators (DGSs). And, building a website with a static site generator is fairly straight forward, once you learn the particulars of the SSG.  

It's important to note that the term “static” means the SSG builds a page once, in contrast to a DSG that builds pages as they are requested by the viewer. The net results are pages display identically without anyone being the wiser. "Static" doesn't mean the site or pages never change or doesn't have dynamic features.  

The popularity of the Jamstack (JavaScript, APIs and Markup) over the last several years has help boost the desire to use SSGs. To complement this desire there are a growing number of open source static site generators available to choose from including Gatsby, Jekyll, Hugo, 11ty and Pelican. At their core, these solutions compile the digital assets you need for deploying your site to the hosting platform of your choice.
