### First of all, what is the Jamstack?

To be clear, it has nothing to do with jam, fruit preserves, or stacks of a classic PB'n J sandwich. In simple terms, the Jamstack originally referred to the use of JavaScript (JS), Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), and Markup (HTML) that would pre-render web pages with the help of a static site generator. More recently the Jamstack environment has expanded to include other technologies, while still encompassing the static site methodology.

### Traditional E-comm vs. Jamstack E-comm

Typically, the traditional e-commerce platform and it's dependencies need to live in the same household. If you think about how solutions like WordPress, Joomla, Rails, or in the case of e-commerce, Magento, the plugins or modules that made to solution work had to be inside the house and be compatible with the platform. With the Jamstack, the APIs that power those extension can now live on their own and be used to drive a very dynamic static e-commerce website.

With the inclusion of JS, APIs from AuthO, Stripe and the like, plus markup, you can use a static site generator to produce a stunning e-commerce experience. This is not a Shopify replacement. For small, independent, shop owner's, the Jamstack may not be orderly enough or evolved to the point that an e-com store can be spun up easily within an hour. But, for those who are technically savvy or have the budget to invest in development time, the Jamstack is a very viable solution. Many times the pay offs of a static Jamstack based site are faster load times, more reliability, improved security, and in the long run, less expensive.
