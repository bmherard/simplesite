 <h2>What to do when things go south?</h2>  

I received an urgent text from David at <a href="https://carolinaconcreteinc.com" target="_blank">Carolina Concrete</a>, not too long ago. "My site has been hacked and we can't recover anything recent. Can you help me?" Of course I said, "Yes"!

<h3>HTML, CSS, and a dash of PHP to the rescue!</h3>

I was able to act quickly and determined that the site could easily be built statically with HTML and CSS.  I have a little bit of PHP knowledge so I was able to create includes for the header, footer and recurring Free Quote call-to-action that appears throughout the site. In pretty short order I had a new site up and generating leads.

In addition to HTML, CSS and PHP, the site includes a contact form powered by a HubSpot API, and a map powered by a Google API. No database is required for this site since HubSpot captures leads in a CRM dashboard. The original site had not been updated for sometime so I made sure that the code was mobile friendly and that the site was served from a secure connection.

<h3>On going support</h3>

I help <a href="https://carolinaconcreteinc.com" target="_blank">Carolina Concrete</a> maintain their local search listings for sites like Google, Bing and Yelp. Additionally, I'm currently working on Search Engine Optimization for the site with relevant content and meta descriptions that support search engine listings.
